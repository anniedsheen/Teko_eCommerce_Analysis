# Project Background
Teko Electronics has been a prominent player in the consumer electronics retail space since its founding in 2012. As a specialized e-commerce retailer based in the United States with a growing international consumer base, the business focuses exclusively on high-demand technology products, positioning itself as the go-to destination for premium electronics including laptops, mobile accessories, and gaming peripherals.
The business operates on a direct-to-consumer model through its proprietary e-commerce platform, with customer acquisition driven through diversified digital marketing channels. Unlike broad-spectrum electronics retailers, Teko Electronics has carved out a niche by curating a focused product portfolio of premium technology items that appeal to professionals, gamers, and technology enthusiasts.
