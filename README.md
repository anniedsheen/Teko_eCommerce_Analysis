![Teko banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9f654a0-9afe-4bce-b032-97aaec142bf2)

## The goal of this analysis is to evaluate sales performance through the COVID-19 period (2019-2022), delivering insights on key revenue drivers and actionable recommendations for Operations, Sales, and Marketing leadership teams.


# Project Background
**Company Bio**

Teko Electronics has been a prominent player in the consumer electronics retail space since its founding in 2012. As a specialized e-commerce retailer based in the United States with a growing international consumer base, the business focuses exclusively on high-demand technology products, positioning itself as the go-to destination for premium electronics including laptops, mobile accessories, and gaming peripherals.
The business operates on a direct-to-consumer model through its proprietary e-commerce platform, with customer acquisition driven through diversified marketing channels. Unlike other large electronics retailers, Teko Electronics has carved out a niche by curating a focused product portfolio of premium technology items that appeal to professionals, gamers, and technology enthusiasts.

**Stakeholder Request**

Leadership requested this analysis in Q2 2023 to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted sales performance from 2019-2022. The period represents a critical inflection point for technology retailers, with dramatic shifts in consumer behavior, supply chain disruptions, and evolving work-from-home requirements.

Understanding these performance patterns will inform strategic planning for 2024 priorities, including loyalty program evaluation, refund cost reduction initiatives, and international market expansion decisions. The insights from this analysis will be particularly valuable as we navigate the post-pandemic market normalization and prepare for potential future disruptions.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Revenue Trends and Growth Analysis:** Overall sales performance, monthly and yearly growth rates, and key inflection points
- **Loyalty Program Performance:** Evaluation of the new loyalty program's impact on repeat purchases and revenue contribution
- **Regional Performance Segementation** Sales performance across regions, focusing on differences in revenue, AOV, and customer behavior
- **Refund Impact Analysis:** Refund behavior across product categories, including refund rates, associated costs, and their effects on profitability

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Teko Electronics experienced explosive pandemic-driven growth peaking at $10M in 2020, but revenue has since declined 46% as market conditions normalized, highlighting the need for sustainable growth strategies beyond remote work trends. The loyalty program is counterproductive, with non-loyalty customers outperforming across all metrics, while APAC represents significant untapped growth potential with premium customer behavior. Quality challenges are eroding over $1M annually and require immediate attention to protect profitability as the company transitions to sustainable post-pandemic growth.

### Key themes for leadership
**1. Growth Strategy:** Pandemic boom was unsustainable, but core products remain reliable drivers worth priortizing

**2. Resource Reallocation:** Loyalty program is underperforming, but APAC shows premium customer behavior worth scaling

**3. Operational Efficiency:** High refund costs for the Macbook Air and Gaming Montior threaten margins and require investigation

* **2020 was the best performing year over the 2019-2022 time period**, generating over $10M in revenue. The top selling products - Gaming Monitor, Apple Airpods, and Macbook Air - collectively drove over 80% of sales that year.

* **Revenue peaked in December 2020 at just over $1.2M**, representing our highest single-month performance during the analysis period.
  
* **Annual revenue growth peaked between 2019-2020 at 163%**, likely driven by pandemic-induced demand for remote work technology. Macbook Air and ThinkPad laptops experienced the highest individual product growth rates at 384% and 222% respectively.
  
* **The largest monthly growth spike was from February 2020 to March 2020**, coinciding with inital COVID lockdowns, with all products experiencing revenue increases during this period.

* **Revenue declined sharply from 2021-2022 with a 46% drop**, reaching an all-time low of $178K in October 2022, with the only exceoptions being slight seasonal holiday upticks in November and December, suggesting market normalization post-pandemic.

* **Loyalty customer revenue continues to decline from its peak in Dec 2021**, generating less revenue than non-loyalty customers by the end of 2022.

* **Non-loyalty customers outperformed loyalty customers**, with 13% higher average order value and comprising 61% of total sales during the analysis period, suggesting the program may not be effectively incentivizing higher spending.
  
* **Loyalty revenue declined 83% while AOV only declined 17%** following Q4 2021, indicating an issue with loyalty customer retention.
  
* **Active loyalty customer participation is decreasing**, with non-loyalty customers placing more orders than loyalty customers in the past 4 months, raising questions about program engagement and value proposition.
  
* **The loyalty program is performing worse at driving repeat purchases**, with only 0.5% of loyalty customers making more than one purchase compared to 11% of non-loyalty customers

* **All regions experienced similar revenue patterns**, peaking during 2020-2021 COVID period before declining, indicating global market forces drove performance more than regional factors

* **APAC customers show the highest spending per order at $280 AOV** but generated the second-lowest total revenue, suggesting limited market reach despite premium customer behavior

* **Refund rates spiked in H1 2022 and have remained elevated**, indicating potential quality or customer satisfaction issues

* **Refund costs are projected to match 2022 levels** based on current trends through the first half of 2023
  
* **Laptops show the highest refund rates**, with both ThinkPads and Apple MacBooks experiencing significantly more returns than other product categories at 12% and 11% respectively
  
* **Gaming monitors and MacBook Air drive the highest refund costs** due to their premium price points, collectively reducing gross revenue by nearly $1.4M

  
# Recommendations

Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend teams to consider the following: 

* **Focus marketing spend and inventory investment on our top three core products, the Gaming Monitor, Apple Airpods, and MacBook Air**. These products have proven to be reliable market drivers during both growth and decline periods.

* **Evaluate Loyalty Program ROI and conduct customer interviews to evaluate what value, if any, we can offer to customers through this program**. Loyalty customers are generating less revenue and have lower AOV than non-loyalty customers, so it's important that this program is able to incentivize higher spending or encourage more repeat purchasing behavior.
  
* **Consider reallocating resources from the Loyalty Program to focus on APAC expansion initiatives**, targeting customer acquisition in a market where customers already demonstrate 7% higher spending patterns.
    
* **Identify root cause issues leading to continued evelated refund costs**, since this suggests a potential systematic issue. Refund rates spiked in H1 2022 and has remained elevated, putting us on track to match 2022 refund costs by the end of this year.

* **Investigate potential issues with our laptop suppliers**, given that the refund rate for the MacBook Air and ThinkPad Laptops are 11-12% compared to 1-6% for other products.


# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The company's main database structure consists of the following four tables:
- **customers:** Details about the creation fo the customer's account
- **geo_lookup:** Reference of countries and their respective region
- **order_status:** Dates for the various statuses of each order
- **orders:** Product and price information for each order


# Assumptions and Caveats

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Orders with $0 transaction prices is missing data and not customers who received products for free
  
* Fluctuations in pricing within individual products were purchases made with coupons or special discounts and not changes in retail pricing
  
* Mismatches between currency and country per customer was due to customers purchasing items in a different currency than where they are located

* When calculating repeat purchases, customer loyalty status was determined based on their loaylty status for their most recent purchase
